this is a project I created for myself to practice my skills, particular in creating an automation testing framework:

Technologies I used:
* CypressJS to implement automation testing
* Cucumber/Gherkin to create feature files and to run the automation tests
* Allure reporting to show the reporting 

What I have done so far: 
* Simple log in (unsuccessfull and successfull)
* Downloading a file and verifying location
* Adding/Removing items to a shopping cart 


NPM Installs
 * npm install cypress --save-dev
 * npm i --save-dev cypress-downloadfile
 * npm i -D cypress @bahmutov/cypress-esbuild-preprocessor esbuild
 * npm install @badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
